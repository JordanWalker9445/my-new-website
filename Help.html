			<h1> Restorative Dispositions!</h1> 
		
			<p> Well What is Resotorative Disposition?</p>
			
		<p>A Restorative Disposition is disciplinary action that is used for restoring the harm done instead of Just giving the child consequences.More and more schools are having restorative practices. The reason why restorative practices are so good is because giving a child a consequence isn't fixing the problem mentally it's only changing how their lives are changing. What Restorative practices do they get in the mindset of that student and help fix the problem mentally so they can change their behavior.Types of restorative practices could be Circles, Mentoring, Counseling, and peer help. In Philadelphia there are different restorative programs that are really making an impact.
