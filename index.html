			<h1> School to prison Pipeline</h1>

		<p> The School-to-prison pipeline is a metaphor used to describe the rate in which student have with the juvenile and adult criminal justice systems as a result of  the educational institutions, and the use of police officers in schools. The cause of this is majority the Disciplinary policies, specifically the zero tolerance policies. Any Policies that remove students from the school environment increases the probability of a youth coming into contact with the incarceration system.Which in end result is not helping the student to become better for society. The Zero-tolerance policies criminalize minor infractions of school rules, while cops in schools lead to students being criminalized for behavior that should be handled inside the school. The School to prison pipeline is a very serious and ongoing epidemic that needs to be stopped. According to Tahlia Gonzales's, The School disciplinary policies disproportionately affect Black and Latino youth in the education system, a practice known as the discipline gap. Black students are suspended and expelled at a rate three times greater than white students. The Advancement Project found that "In the 2006-2007 school year, there was no state in which African-American students were not suspended more often than white students" Proving that some type of racials divisions has a part with the School to prison pipeline.</p>
