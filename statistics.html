		<li>According to the U.S. Department of Justice, which in 2013 ordered school districts to respond to student misbehavior in “fair, non-discriminatory, and effective” ways. Black students are suspended and expelled at a rate three times greater than White students, while Black and Latino students account for 70 percent of police referrals. </li>
  
		<li>Black students do not “act out” in class more frequently than their White peers. But Black students are more likely to be sent to the principal’s office for subjective offenses, like “disrupting class”.  White students, on the other hand, are more likely to be suspended for objective offenses, like drug possession. 
</li>
  
		<li>Even In Preschool, Black children represent 18 percent of preschool students, but account for 48 percent of pre-school suspensions. Yes, we’re talking about 4-year-olds.
